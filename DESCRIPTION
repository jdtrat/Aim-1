Description: This package is used to simulate the basic task struture of the PIP, where participants are presented with a cued interval of time and asked to reproduce the cued interval in the presence and absence of reinforcements. The simulated behavior is then modeled using a valence paritioned reinforcement learning algorithm that partitions out the valence of rewards from punishments using a reinforcement learning framework. We use this model to show that reinforcement learning algorithms can be used to track time perception behavior.
